# React + Vite

Application made with React in conjunction with vite:
Three-in-one game in which different concepts are applied such as component states, children, saving information in the localStorage so that each game is saved when the page is updated, index re-rendering, among others.

Currently, there are two official plugins available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
